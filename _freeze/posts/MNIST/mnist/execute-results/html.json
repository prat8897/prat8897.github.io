Everyone who's dabbled in ML has probably trained a model to recognize these digits. But today, I want to share a creative approach that looks at this classic problem through the lens of physics.\n\n## The Gravity MNIST Method\n\nThe premise is wonderfully simple: what if we treat each pixel in a digit image as a \"particle of sand\"? The brighter the pixel, the more sand is present. Now, let's apply gravity and see what happens when all that sand falls to the bottom of the image.\n\nThis approach transforms our 2D image into a 1D distribution - essentially a histogram of where the \"sand\" landed. But we don't stop there. We apply gravity in all four cardinal directions (down, right, up, left) to get a more complete picture of the digit's structure.\n\nThe real magic happens when we model each of these distributions as a mixture of Gaussian curves. The parameters of these Gaussians - their means, variances, and weights - become our features for classification.\n\n## Implementation\n\nHere's how it works in practice:\n\n1. Load the MNIST data: Each image is a grayscale 8Ã—8 grid of pixels\n2. Apply \"gravity\": Sum pixel values along columns to simulate sand falling down\n3. Repeat for all directions: Rotate and repeat to get distributions for right, up, and left\n4. Fit Gaussian mixtures: Model each distribution as a mixture of Gaussian curves\n5. Extract features: Use the parameters of these curves as features\n6. Train a classifier: Feed these features into a Random Forest classifier\n\nFitting the Gaussian Mixture model to the data happens like so:\n\n::: {#5e38b744 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture\n# Function to fit a Gaussian Mixture Model to the distribution\ndef fit_gmm(distribution, n_components=3):\n    # Prepare the data for GMM (needs to be 2D array)\n    X = np.column_stack((np.arange(len(distribution)), distribution))\n    \n    # Fit the GMM\n    gmm = GaussianMixture(n_components=n_components, random_state=42)\n    gmm.fit(X)\n    \n    return {\n        'means': gmm.means_.flatten(),\n        'variances': gmm.covariances_.flatten() if gmm.covariance_type == 'full' else gmm.covariances_.flatten(),\n        'weights': gmm.weights_\n    }\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen, we simply train a Random Forest Classifier on these values.

This approach achieves over 91% accuracy on the test set without any complex neural networks or deep learning. That's quite impressive for such a simple, physics-inspired method!\n\n## Why Does This Work?\nThe gravity method works because it captures structural information about the digits in a compact form. For example:\n\n- A \"1\" will have a concentrated pile when gravity pulls right, but a more spread-out distribution when gravity pulls down\n- An \"8\" will typically have two peaks when gravity pulls down (from its two loops)\n- A \"7\" will have a distinctive distribution when gravity pulls from the left\n\nBy capturing these characteristics from all four directions and encoding them as Gaussian parameters, we create a rich feature set that a classifier can use to distinguish between digits.\n\n## Beyond MNIST\n\nThis \"gravitational feature extraction\" technique could potentially be applied to other image classification problems. It's particularly interesting for cases where:\n\nThe objects have distinctive shapes\nComputational resources are limited\nYou want a more interpretable model than deep learning often provides\n\nThe physics-inspired approach also reminds us that sometimes looking at a problem through a different lens - in this case, literally imagining pixels as sand particles - can lead to creative solutions.\n\n## Conclusion\nMachine learning doesn't always have to mean complex neural networks and black-box models. Sometimes, a creative approach inspired by physical intuition can yield surprisingly good results.\n\nThe Gravity MNIST method is a perfect example of cross-disciplinary thinking: taking a concept from physics (gravity) and applying it to a classic machine learning problem. It's a reminder that creativity still has an important place in the age of large models and big data.\n\nWould this approach ever beat state-of-the-art deep learning models on MNIST? Probably not. But at 91% accuracy with a beautifully simple approach, it's a wonderful example of how thinking differently can lead to elegant solutions.\n\n",
